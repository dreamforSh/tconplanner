Tinkers' Blueprint is a client-side add-on for Tinkers' Construct 3 that allows players to preview assembled tools in a blueprint interface and view their stats. This can help avoid situations where you craft a tool expecting it to be powerful, only to be disappointed with the result.

After installing this mod, an icon will appear in the GUI of the Tinker Station and Tinker's Anvil. Click it to open the Planner UI.

Here, you can freely design tools with any combination of parts (even if you don't have them on hand) and preview the final product's properties.

You can bookmark your "crafted" tool designs for future reference, sort parts based on specific attributes (like mining speed and durability), and even randomly combine materials for fun.
